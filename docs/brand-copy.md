This document defines the core messaging, tone, and values that shape the identity of ConvictionFi — a conviction-first platform for autonomous Web3 investing.

## 🏷️ Tagline

> **Mint Your Conviction.**  
> _DeFAI Agent as NFTMint._

## 📣 Brand Message

> The NFT isn’t just a token.  
> It’s your **Guardian** — standing between you and DeFi & Crypto Investing.  
> A **Safety Layer**, encoded with conviction.

## 📝 Short Description

ConvictionFi empowers individuals to crystallize their convictions into autonomous AI agents, encoded as NFTs.

Let your conviction observe the world, make decisions, and trade — all without your permission or presence.

The agent’s strategy is stored transparently on **Walrus** as NFT metadata, so you know exactly how it thinks.

**You don’t trade anymore.**  
**Your conviction does.**

## 🚀 Brand Purpose

To simplify DeFi investing through autonomous, conviction-driven agents —  
enabling anyone to act on belief, not expertise.

## 🧭 Core Values

- **Autonomy**: The user mints once. The agent thinks and acts independently.
- **Transparency**: Every strategy is stored and visible on-chain (via Walrus).
- **Simplicity**: No dashboards to babysit. No manual trades. Just conviction.
- **Conviction over Noise**: Decisions are rooted in belief, not trends or panic.

## 🗣 Tone of Voice

- Confident, but not arrogant
- Professional and restrained — no hype, no memes
- Speaks to those who think long-term
- Uses suggestive language:
  - ✅ “Let your conviction evolve.”
  - ❌ “Buy now!” or “Don’t miss out!”

## ✅ Do / ❌ Don’t
